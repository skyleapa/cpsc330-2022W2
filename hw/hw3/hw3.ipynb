    "_Usually having more data for training is a good idea. But here we're using a 60%/40% split because this is kind of a big dataset for a modest laptop. A smaller training set means that it won't take too long to train the model on your laptop. A side advantage of this would be that with a bigger test split, we'll have a more reliable estimate of the deployment performance!_"

The baseline model gives a validation accuracy of 0.760, with the next highest validation scores as decision tree (0.814), kNN (0.833) and the best with RBF SVM (0.867). This assures us that the models are improving the accuracy and we are performing relevant applications. The corresponding training scores also become closer to the increasing validation scores with each model. Although RBF SVM has the best validation accuracy, it also has the longest fit and score times by far. The fastest model would be the kNN model. "

    "1. I learned about the importance of preprocessing and the different ways that you can prepare data. I learned how to analyze a dataset to determine what processing to perform, then how to choose between different methods such as OHE vs Ordinal Encoder. I also learned how to carry out these transformations and incorporate pipelines to preserve the golden rule. I then learned how to evaluate different models and apply cross-validation, as well as choosing between hyperparameters to determine the most accurate model. I evaluated these models based on their validation score and fit/model time. It was extremely rewarding to apply my theory into practice on real data.\n",
